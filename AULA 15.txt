			class x objects
	for example:
		arquitech of a house = class
		house = object

		class is the struture

	example:
		    ------> CAR 1 (object)
	car (class)
		    ------> CAR 2 (object)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			magic methods
 def __init__():
     ----> atributtes of the class

 example:

	class Car:
	   def __init__(*self*, model (atributes), price):
	(self is reference)
	   
 in Python we need to declair the variable and the ""key""
	example:
		self.model = model

 init is the definition of the atributes

.__str__():
   -----> is a magic method to convert number in strings (texts)

always put a "self" to "call/reference" an attribute in a class

f = format = form to "connect(concatenar) things"
self = referente

if inicializate with .__ is a magic method

EXAMPLE:
	my_car = Car(
    		color = "Yellow",
    		model = "Kicks",
		)
the COMMON separate the atributes
pay attention in the smallest things

self comunicate everything in the code
